        <p >Even if you’re new to web development, you’ve probably heard the terms “front-end development” and “back-end
        development” before. But what do they mean?
        Front-end web development has to do with the interface that you, the user, interact with when you visit a website or use
        a web application. Front-End Developers create everything you see on a web page, including:
        Back-end web development has to do with the parts of a website that you can’t see, particularly how website information
        is stored and retrieved.
        When you access a webpage in your browser, you’re essentially requesting to see a file stored on a server somewhere.
        When you load a webpage for the first time or sign into a website with a username and password, it’s Back-End Developers
        who make it possible to access website information efficiently and securely.
